# Evaluate semi-supervised learning methods

This repo is used to evaluate different semi-supervised learning methods.

The code is included in the `src` directory. To run the code python 3.10.13 and all libraries in the `requirements.txt` file need to be installed.

The semi-supervised learning methods were evaluated on the [Diabetes prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset?resource=download) from kaggle. To re-run the analysis this dataset needs to be saved in the `res` directory. 

My analysis can be reproduced by running the `analysis.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks` directory.
